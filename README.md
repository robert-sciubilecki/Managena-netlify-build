"This project marks my first substantial venture into JavaScript, and I view it as a valuable stepping stone in preparing for more advanced frameworks and libraries like React and Node. I take pride in this accomplishment, having written the majority of the code myself, with some guidance from online resources and ChatGPT.

While I initially had a well-structured plan within the context of the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture, the project grew in complexity as I introduced new features. Consequently, a few bugs emerged, and my approach shifted from addressing the root causes to applying patches. As a result, the codebase expanded, although the core functionality remains intact.

This project exhibits dynamic behavior and follows a design reminiscent of the early 2010s. While the design is not cutting-edge, it serves its purpose, given my limited design skills.

Looking ahead, there are several areas I intend to improve:

Responsiveness: I plan to enhance the project's adaptability to different screen sizes and devices.
Code Quality: I aim to reduce redundancy by introducing more helper functions. For instance, I've found myself reformatting dates in multiple places within the code, which could be more efficiently managed.
Code Structure: The codebase contains classes that share similar functionalities. It would be beneficial to introduce a parent class and use inheritance to reduce repetition. However, this task may be complex due to the project's evolution.
CSS: The current styling is somewhat disorganized, and this also affects the naming of classes. I hope to tidy this up once I gain more familiarity with Sass.
In summary, this project represents a significant step in my journey as a JavaScript developer. While there are areas for improvement, the functionality is solid, and it provides a strong foundation for future learning and refinement."
